This only works for the WCH LinkE in RISC-V mode.  If your programmer has the BLUE light ON shortly after boot your programmer is in ARM mode.

Please follow instructions here to convert your programmer to RISC-V mode from ARM mode.

Basically press-and-hold the ModeS button while plugging in the USB.

Once powered, it will store that to default.

The blue light should be OFF.

Once you are in RISC-V mode, you can install this driver by right-clicking on the driver and saying install.
